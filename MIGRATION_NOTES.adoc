== Migration notes (July 23, 2021 at 11:36:48 AM CEST)

=== Additions

* Bonita projects are now Maven projects and rely on the https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html[Maven dependency mechanism] to manage their dependencies. Check the documentation for more information about https://www.bonitasoft.com/bos_redirect.php?bos_redirect_id=727&bos_redirect_major_version=7.13&bos_redirect_minor_version=0&bos_redirect_product=bos[Project composition].

=== Updates

* Groovy version has been updated from `2.4.x` to `3.0.x`
* Only Java `11` version is now supported. This might impact your existing projet if you were still using Java 8. Some dependencies in your project might be incompatible with the _Java Platform Module System_ introduced in Java 9.

=== Removals

* `lib` folder and its content has been removed.
